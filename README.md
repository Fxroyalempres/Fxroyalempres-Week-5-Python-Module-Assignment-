# Week 5 Python Module Assignment

## Assignment 1: Design Your Own Class! 🏗️

### Instructions:
1. Create a class representing anything you like (e.g., a Smartphone, Book, or even a Superhero!).
2. Add attributes and methods to bring the class to life.
3. Use constructors to initialize each object with unique values.
4. Add an inheritance layer to explore polymorphism or encapsulation.

---

## Activity 2: Polymorphism Challenge! 🎭

### Instructions:
1. Create a program that includes animals, vehicles, or any objects with the same action (e.g., `move()`).
2. Make each class define `move()` differently. For example:
   - `Car.move()` prints "Driving 🚗".
   - `Plane.move()` prints "Flying ✈️".
   - `Boat.move()` prints "Sailing 🚤".

---

### Files Included:
- `superhero.py`: Demonstrates inheritance and polymorphism with superheroes like Batman and Superman.
- `polymorphism.py`: Demonstrates polymorphism with vehicles (`Car`, `Plane`, `Boat`).

---

### How to Run:
1. Open the terminal in the project directory.
2. Run the following commands:
   - For `superhero.py`:
     ```bash
     python superhero.py
     ```
   - For [polymorphism.py](http://_vscodecontentref_/1):
     ```bash
     python polymorphism.py
     ```
